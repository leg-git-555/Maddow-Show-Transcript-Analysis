# Transcript Analysis from *The Rachel Maddow Show* 

This project is an effort to collect and process transcripts from Rachel Maddow's from innauguration day 2021 (01/20/2021) through the 2024 presidential election (11/6/2024). I'm using ChatGPT to write scripts based on my directions.

## Status
Work in progress. First step: filtering URLs and setting up the environment.

## Transcript Source
- internet archive 

## Notes
- Scripts written collaboratively with ChatGPT.
- Goal: download, filter, and analyze transcripts.

## Issues
- Discrepancy between the number of URLs (436) and the number of text files generated from the scraping (126). I'm not sure if the script is missing transcript, combining transcripts from multiple epsidoes into a single file, or if some episodes don't provide text transcripts.
